    To call this class in a programm code one has to provide: the name of the 
    dump files in the same way as it has been called in the LAMMPS's input file
    (with the * character) as well as the name of the log file generated.
    The idea of this class is to extract some important informations needed to 
    study the outcome of the simulation. This class prevent the user to input
    manually in the python programm a lot of data such as the results produced
    by LAMMPS but also some informations that have already been written in the
    input file which would be boring and time consuming to provide again.
    For the moment the use of this class has some requirements on the LAMMPS
    input: you have to use the units metal, you have to decompose your dump
    file in separeted files using the * character (this problem could be
    solved easily by inserting a default argument which could be used to tell
    that the output informations are in a unique dump file and the latter
    could be then decomposed in several textfile using python)

    def highest_disorder(self,peng_name,threshold='npt_standard'):
        '''
        The purpose of this function is to return the index of the snapshot for
        which the disorder is at its maximum.
        The notion of disorder is not obvious and not well define. That is why we
        need to provide a clear definition of how the disorder is measured through
        this function. Knowing that in a perfect crystal all the atoms should be
        at a minimum level of energy (the cohesive energy), more important is the
        disorder in a crystal higher should be the potential energy of the atoms.
        Thus the idea here is to count the number of atoms with a potential energy
        above a given threshold (standard or provided by the user). Indeed we can
        reasonably consider that if the threshold is well chosen, this atom count
        can be a good indicator of the disorder. Therefore basically the function
        count the number of atoms in a high disorder state for each snapshot and
        return the one with the highest number of atoms counted.
        The threshold can be chosen as standard if an equilibration simulation in
        npt environment has been run before the cascade. In this case the temperature
        will be directly extracted through the self variable which has to be a dumplog
        class. If this condition is not respected, the user is invited to provide
        his own threshold.
        The treshold in the standard condition is calculated using the following
        formula : threshold=10*((3/2)*k*T) with k, the Boltzmann constant and T the 
        temperature extracted from self (dumplog class). It is thus advised to the
        user to estimate the temperature and to use a similar kind of threshold 
        to get consistent results. 
        The cohesive energy is estimated using the average of the potential energy
        of the first snapshot (before that the cascade starts really) even if it
        actually estimates the cohesive energy plus the average kinetic energy.
        self is a dumplog variable (see the first class definition).
        threshold must be provided in eV if it is not let as 'npt_standard'.
        Finally note that the user must provide the name which is used to
        characterise the column in the dump file where the potential energy of the
        atoms is stored.
